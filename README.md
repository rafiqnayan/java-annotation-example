# java-annotation-example
Demonstrates a how annotations work in java and how to access them

This project is a simple demonstration of how unit test frameworks use annotations to run tests. The annotations used
in this project are commonly used in unit test frameworks.

`@Test`: indicates this method is a unit test method
`@TesterInfo`: shows the tester information
`@BeforeMethod`: methods annotated with this will run before each test method
